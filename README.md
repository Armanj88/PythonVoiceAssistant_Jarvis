# Python Voice Assistant - Jarvis
This is my last project I worked on it. It's the iron man jarvis. It can help on some calculations or save time. Or help you to do some works with your voice

# Usage
- First of all download all of the files I put on the top of this page. You can click on Code > Download zip or you can use this command and paste it in command prompt:\n
``` git clone https://github.com/Armanj88/PythonVoiceAssistant_Jarvis ```
- Then run ```config.py``` file and put your name and username in that.
- Finally always when you want to run jarvis, only run jarvis.py
**Remember that. You have to download all of that files and put them in one folder to use Jarvis.**
